This is a repository on algorthims and its basic elements.
in insertion.js the function, is an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm, which sorts an array of numbers in ascending order. 
It iterates through the array, comparing each element with those before it and inserting the element into its correct position by shifting larger elements. 
In count.js the function, processes a sentence character by character to count its total number of characters, words, and vowels. 
It traverses the sentence while maintaining counters for each metric and adjusts the word count based on spaces and non-space characters. 
Together, these functions demonstrate basic algorithmic techniques for sorting and text analysis.
